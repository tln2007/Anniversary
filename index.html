      <p> HAPPY ONE YEAR BABY! I wanted to try a different approach to writing a message so I made this quick website. I apologize if it looks a little rusty. Anyway, I am surprised we’ve only been together for a year because we are so established. Is it weird that I feel like I’ve known you my whole life? Well I mean. I kinda have. I’ve known you since we were 11 and now I’m almost 19. You’re my best friend. For now and for always. I love you. </p>
